**Rules:** [00-rules §12](./00-rules-and-conventions.md#12-screen-code--version-claude-design-provenance). `Code` and `Version` are **supplied by Claude Design** - copy verbatim, never invent. On every re-pull from Claude Design: bump the version here + in the feature-doc header, and append a Changelog line. `-` = not yet recorded (fill from Claude Design).
